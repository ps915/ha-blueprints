## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Trigger 🌡️:** Automation starts whenever the whirlpool temperature sensor changes.  
2. **Heating Rate Check ⚡:**  
   - Uses optional heating rate sensor if enabled and value is valid.  
   - Otherwise, falls back to Default Heating Rate.  
3. **Validation 🛡️:**  
   - Dynamic sensor value is only used if it is between 75%–150% of Default Rate.  
   - Invalid or missing values → Default Rate is used.  
4. **Time Calculation ⏳:**  
   - Calculates estimated remaining time based on current temp, target temp, and validated heating rate.  
5. **Start Timer 🚀:**  
   - The selected timer helper is set to the calculated duration and started. Countdown can be monitored in your dashboard.
